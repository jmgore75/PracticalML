# A practical guide to applied machine learning

To say machine learning is a big subject is a big understatement - it can be difficult to know where to even begin!  But understanding and applying machine learning may be easier than you think.  

Using python and scikit-learn, we'll walk through a machine learning process from start to finish.  Along the way we'll discuss when to apply machine learning, the most successful algorithms, best practices, and even a bit of philosophy.
