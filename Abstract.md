# A practical guide to applied machine learning

- To say machine learning is a big subject is a big understatement



- Know your problem
- Know your data
- Preprocess your data
- Set up an all-purpose test harness
- Spot check a variety of algorithms and pursue
- I'll be using Python's scikit-learn and nolearn


- In my experience
  - Neural networks are best for numerical data, especially homogenous data
  - Convolutional layers are a necessity for data with structure (i.e. images)
  - Forests work best for

- Using ML to learn from your data
  - Using forests and dimension reduction to identify your important variables

- Starting algorithms
  - Extremely randomized trees
  - PCA
  - Logistic regression
  - Neural Networks
    - Extreme Learning Machines
    - Basic 1 and 2-layer
    - Convolutional input

- Technical
  - Preprocessing data (whitening)
  - Keeping track of your progress
  - Layering
  - Ensembles

- Conceptual
  - Supervised and Unsupervised
  - The human element in the ML process
  - Any algorithm could be the right one - but it will probably be one of these
  - Big data, small data, and expanded data
  - Dealing with bias in your training set
  - Catastrophic forgetting
  - ML on small hardware
  - The value of a good API

- Touch on
  - Dataframes are great but non-essential
  - What you need to understand before delving deeper (matrix algebra and )
  - Highly recommended learning resources (blogs and courses)
  - Using your gpu (often hard to set up but totally worth it)
  - Cloud computing
  - Batch and online algorithms
  - Exciting algorithms
