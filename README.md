A practical guide to applied machine learning
================

This project is built to support the Tessella Autumn Conference presentation "A practical guide to applied machine learning".  You may view this presentation directly:

[here](http://rawgit.com/jmgore75/PracticalML/master/conference2015.html#/title)

# Presentation Files

The main presentation file is in [conference2015.html](conference2015.html).  The presentation is based on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) and includes that code in the [reveal.js](reveal.js) directory.  The presentation makes use of [d3.js](http://d3js.org/).  I do not recommend using this repository to create your own presentation.  Instead I recommend forking reveal.js directly.  

Notes about the presentation are here:
- [Requirements](presentation/Requirements.md)
- [Abstract](presentation/Abstract.md)

# Code

All python code used to generate figures is in [src](src) or in [presentation](presentation).  You may find the modules in src to be useful.  

# Foundational discussions of ML

The following are standalone analysis of machine learning, and were notes for content in the actual presentation.  As these are basically notes I make no guarantees as to the readability of the content.  

- [Setting up your ML environment](Environment.md)
- [The process of applying machine learning](Process.md)
- [Geometric Interpretation of data](GeometricInterpretation.md)
- [Algorithms](Algorithms.md)
  - [Linear models and techniques](Linear.md)
  - [Neural networks](NeuralNetworks.md)
  - [Support Vector Machines](SupportVectorMachines.md)
  - [Random forests](RandomForests.md) and decision trees
  - [Dimensionality reduction](DimensionalityReduction.md)
  - [Probabilistic modeling](Probabilistic.md)
- [Resources](Resources.md) and other useful articles
