## Overview of machine learning approach
<http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/>

This is a pretty good article about how to approach machine learning:
* Top-down (objective, not algorithm focused)
* Use a systematic approach to
* guarantee that the end result is good (often more reliable than accurate)
* Tool agnostic

Here's the process:
1. Define problem
2. Prepare data
3. Spot check algorithms
4. Improve results
5. Present results
6. Deploy and Use

Recommended tools
* Weka (graphical, good for one-off)
* Scikit-learn (develop and deploy)
* Deep dive (R caret)

Datasets
* [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
* Kaggle
* [KDD Cup](http://www.sigkdd.org/kddcup/index.php)
* Avoid image and text data, too specialized to start

Development tips
* Write up what you did
* Version of course, save to public Repository
* Focus on small data

## Caret Package
R package that handles model creation, discovery, and tuning
