## Important Session Information

- Sessions are 35 minutes long, including questions.
- Sessions will be recorded using specialised screen capture software on the machine. Unless absolutely necessary, speakers should use the EPIC provided laptop that will already be correctly configured. If you have a good reason to provide your own laptop, such as use of licensed software in demonstrations, pre-installed IDEs etc., you will have to make sure that you have installed the correct recording software on the laptop and that it is running when you speak.
- There will be a best session prize awarded based on the attendee feedback.
