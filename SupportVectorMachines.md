## Support Vector Machines and Kernel-based algorithms

Handle high-dimensional (lots of features) well

Feature combinations may cause explosive requirements in memory and computational complexity, and require more training examples to compensate for the increase in features.  Kernels avoid this by rewriting linear models in a way that doesnâ€™t require computing the feature combinations.
