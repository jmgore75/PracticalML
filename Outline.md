# A Practical guide to Machine Learning

## What algorithms do I need to know how to use?

* Extremely Randomized Forests
* Deep Neural Networks
  * Fully Connected Layers
  * Convolutional Layers
  * Pooling layers
  * Dropout
  * Activation Functions
    * ReLU
    * Sigmoid/Tanh
    * Nothing!
  * Experimental architectures
    * MaxOut (Pooling)
    * ChannelOut
* Extreme Learning Machines
* 

## Pitfalls

* Impractically large models
*

## Decision Trees

The trick is

## Linear/Logistic

### Solving analytically

Using SVD algorithm

### Solving with Gradient descent



## Layered Approaches

Each layer feeds into the next

The network can be trained through backwards propogation when using an iterative training approach.  

## Major recipes
