## Steps

- Know your problem
- Know your data (is it text, is it image)
- Set up your test harness
  - Wrangle your data (e.g. from text)
  - Preprocess your data (whitening)
  - Train, test (with cross validation)
  - Pick performance measure (usually accuracy)
- Set up an all-purpose test harness
- Spot check a variety of algorithms
- Fine tune the best ones
- Experiment with preprocessing and ensembles
