## A practical guide to machine learning ***
Focus on getting to a useful model as quickly and painlessly as possible

- Supervised only
- teach about most useful modern algorithms only (and ignore the rest)
- Choosing initial and tuning hyperparameters
- use a framework that can be quickly put up and running

## A practical guide to deep learning ***
How to develop a deep learning model given arbitrary input data

- Understanding your input data and the all-important initial layers
- How to expand your training data
- Choosing initial and tuning hyperparameters
- Start small and expand?


## Machine Learning for Sequences **
How to develop machine learning models which accept and/or output sequences of data.  

- Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs
- Learning internal state
- Training across time

## Using machine learning to understand your data
Focus on finding patterns and insights in your data that can be applied elsewhere

- Unsupervised only

## Kaggle for fun and profit
An example of machine learning by way of a Kaggle competition

## Machine learning in the cloud
Guide to machine learning by way of the cloud

- Advantages and disadvantages
  - Pros
    - Don't have to worry about having or maintaining hardware
  - Cons
    - It costs money (but probably less than an decent gpu setup)
- How to start
- A practical example


## Machine learning with Julia

Is expressive and handles a lot of stuff automatically but is still a pretty
immature language.
